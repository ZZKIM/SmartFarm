# Insect Smart Farm Management System

This project aims to create a smart farm management system for insect cultivation. It utilizes various sensors to monitor the environment and optimize growth conditions.

## Features

- Measures temperature and humidity using DHT11 sensor.
- Monitors soil moisture using a soil moisture sensor.
- Maintains optimal temperature at 30Â°C and humidity at 40%.
- Displays sensor readings on an LCD module.
- Controls growth LED and misting module based on conditions.

## Setup

1. Connect the DHT11 sensor, soil moisture sensor, LCD module, and relay modules as described in the project code.
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.
3. The code will read sensor values, adjust conditions, and control the LED and misting module accordingly.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the setup instructions above.
3. Upload the Arduino sketch to your board.
4. Monitor the LCD display for sensor readings and control actions.
